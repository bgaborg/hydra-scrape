# Streamlit projects
This repository contains the code for the Streamlit projects I have worked on. Streamlit is an open-source app framework for Machine Learning and Data Science projects. It is a great tool for creating web apps for your ideas.

## Projects
- scrape-hydra: A web app that scrapes json files, and search it's concents. It is really easy to build it with Streamlit, and deploy it anywhere with the docker image.
